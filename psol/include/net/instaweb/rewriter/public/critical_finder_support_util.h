// This contains some utilities for working with the critical_keys
// proto, and for updating support values. This is primarily used by
// CriticalSelectorFinder and CriticalImagesFinder.  These finders use the
// critical_keys proto to store a "support value" for each possible key (image
// URL or selector name) in the property cache.  When a beacon result arrives,
// the support for each critical key in the result is increased by
// support_interval.  When a new beacon is sent, existing support is decayed by
// multiplying by support_interval/(support_interval+1) and rounding down.  This
// means that a single key returned with a beacon will be considered critical
// until support_interval subsequent beacons have been injected.  Because
// support decays exponentially, repeated support for a key in multiple beacon
// results cause that key to be considered critical longer: two beacon results
// will expire after somewhat less than twice as long, three after rather less
// than three times as long, and so forth. This class also handles converting
// over old protobufs that did not use the support system.
